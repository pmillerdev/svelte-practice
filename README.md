# Svelte

- Svelte is a compiler
- It has no runtime
- Compiles code at buildtime
- Converts declarative components in to imperative JS code for the browser
- Removes the need for Virtual DOM, which increases speed and performance due to no re-renders
- Lightweight with ~40% Less code than React
- Includes lots of helpful features e.g. accessibility checking, source maps and animations
- Uses two way data binding, unlike React

## Lifecycle Methods

- onMount = point after which component is first rendered to DOM
