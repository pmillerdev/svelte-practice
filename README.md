# Svelte

- Svelte is basically a compiler
- Compiles code at buildtime instead of runtime
- Converts declarative components in to imperative JS code for the browser
- Removes the need for Virtual DOM, which increases speed and performance due to no re-renders
- No need for hooks or state lifecycle events
- 40% Less code than React
- Includes lots of helpful features e.g. accessibility checking, source maps and animations
